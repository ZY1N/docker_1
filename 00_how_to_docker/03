eval $(docker-machine env Char)
#docker-machine env hooks up docker command to run against a machine
    #aka this means that we are setting up docker to run on the docker-machine named Char
#eval is part of POSIX- It will take an argument and construct a command of it, which will be executed by the shell.
#note you don't really need the eval command, but it's suggested. It concatinates things
